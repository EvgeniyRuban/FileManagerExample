# FileManagerExample

### Rules for creating a custom operation:
- each operation can have only one command in its signature;
- a command and modifiers of operation cannot have the same declaration;
- each operation modifier must have a unique declaration;
- the parameters accepted by the operation must necessarily be limited by double quotes (") characters;
- command and modifiers of operation cannot be compound;
- if the operation mask contains a continuous sequence of parameters in which there are required ones, required parameters should go first of the sequence.
